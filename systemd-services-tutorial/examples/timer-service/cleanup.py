cleanup.py
----------
A maintenance script designed to be run on a schedule by a systemd timer.
Deletes files older than MAX_AGE_DAYS from TARGET_DIR.

This is a realistic example of a periodic task that many embedded devices
need — clearing old logs, sensor data, or temporary files to prevent the
storage from filling up over time.

Key design points for a timer-triggered script:
  - It runs once and exits (does not loop forever like a long-running service)
  - It logs clearly so you can see what happened in: journalctl -u cleanup.service
  - It exits with code 0 on success and non-zero on partial failure, so
    systemd can accurately report whether the task succeeded

Deploy:
  sudo cp cleanup.service /etc/systemd/system/
  sudo cp cleanup.timer   /etc/systemd/system/
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable --now cleanup.timer

Check scheduled runs:
  systemctl list-timers

Trigger manually to test:
  sudo systemctl start cleanup.service
  journalctl -u cleanup.service -n 30
