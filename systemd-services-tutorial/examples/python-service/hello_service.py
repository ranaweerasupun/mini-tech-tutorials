"""
hello_service.py
----------------
A minimal long-running Python service for learning systemd.
Logs a heartbeat message every 10 seconds so you can watch it
working in real time with: journalctl -u hello-python.service -f

This script intentionally does nothing useful — it is designed
purely to demonstrate the lifecycle of a process that systemd
starts, monitors, and restarts if it dies.

Deploy:
  sudo cp hello-python.service /etc/systemd/system/
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable --now hello-python.service
